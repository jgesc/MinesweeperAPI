## Examples
### Intended game workflow
 1. Create game through PUT request, modifying the game settings if desired, obtain the game **ID**
 2. Open an unknown cell thorugh POST request on path /**ID**, sending the **x** and **y** coordinates as a JSON formatted body.
 3. Get game state through GET request. Read **state** field. If the value is neither **Win** nor **Lose**, repeat step 2.
 4. If **state** is either **Win** or **Lose**, delete the game with DELETE request on path /**ID**.
